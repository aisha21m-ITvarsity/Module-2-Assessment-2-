In 1995, armed with passion and determination, they broke ground on what would soon become a cornerstone of Pine City's commercial landscape. With a focus on providing a diverse selection of stores and exceptional customer service, the Reid's set out to create more than just a shopping center... they aimed to cultivate a hub of activity where families could come together to shop, dine, and create lasting memories.</p>

            <p>As Pine City Mall grew, so too did its reputation for excellence.
